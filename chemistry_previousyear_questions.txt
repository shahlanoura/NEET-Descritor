2. (a) An Atom has three fundamental particles-electron, proton
and neutron.
The mass of the electron is 9.10939 × 10

–31

kg.

Neutrons and protons, both are collectively known as
nucleons.
All the isotopes of a given element show same chemical
properties.
Dalton’s atomic theory, regarded atom as an ultimate particle
of matter.
3. (b) nm = 2l + 1
As there are (2l + 1) number of permissible values of magnetic
quantum number.
Hence, l =

		
The structures are :
Cl

nm −1

4. (d) Among isoelectronic monoatomic species, size is
inversely proportional to atomic number.
Hence among isoelectronic species Na+, O2–, N3–, F– (having
nearest noble gas configuration);
Order of size is Na+ < F– < O2– < N3–
N3– has least atomic number hence largest size.
5. (b) AlCl3, BeCl2 and PCl5 does not obey octet rule.
AlCl3 and BeCl2 both are electron-deficient species having
six electrons in valence shell of central atom whereas PCl5
has ten electrons in valence shell of phosphorous.

6. (b) σ1s < σ*1s < σ2s < σ* 2s < ( π2p x = π2p y ) <
σ2p z < ( π* 2p x = π* 2p y ) < σ* 2p z

is the correct order of energy of MO for homo nuclear
diatomic species N2.
7. (d) Covalent bonding is NOT an intermolecular force while
rest all are considered as intermolecular forces.
8. (c) PV = nRT
P = nRT.(1/V)
Plot of P vs (1/V) would be straight line passing through
origin having slope = nRT.
At high temperatures, P vs (1/V) would have greater slope.
9. (d) A, B and C are correct statements.
The H-H bond dissociation enthalpy is highest for a single
bond between two atoms of any element.
Hydrogen does not reduce oxides of metals that are more
active than iron.
10. (b) Ca plays important role in Neuromuscular function and
interneuronal transmission
The daily requirement of Mg and Ca in the human body is
estimated to be 200 –300 mg.
All enzymes that utilise ATP in phosphate transfer require
Mg as the cofactor.
The bone in human body is NOT an inert and unchanging
substance.

12. (a) Tl is less stable than Tl (inert pair effect)

Going down the group 13, stability of lower oxidation state
increases.
In case of B, Al, Ga and In, higher O.S. +3 remains more
stable than lower O.S. +1.
But, in last stable element, thallium (Tl), lower O.S. +1
become more stable than higher O.S. +3.

24. (d) BF3 behaves as Lewis acid due to incomplete octet in
valence shell of Boron. Hence it can accept a lone pair of
electrons.
25. (d) The greater stability of Cu2+ (aq) rather than Cu+ (aq) is
due to the much more negative ∆hydH of Cu2+(aq) than Cu+,
which more than compensates for the second ionisation
enthalpy of Cu.

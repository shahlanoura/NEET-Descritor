Explanations
1. (b) Mosses spores released from the capsule germinate to
form the filamentous structure called protonema. It is the
first stage of gametophyte.

8. (c) In eukaryotes, S or Synthesis phase marks the period
during which DNA synthesis or replication takes place.
During this phase the amount of DNA per cell doubles.

2. (c) Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which produce two
kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are
known as heterosporous.

9. (d) Anaphase stage is characterised by the following key
events:
1. Centromeres split and chromatids separate.

3. (b) In fabaceae family the filaments of nine stamen are
united into one bundle and tenth posterior stamen stand
apart (diadelphous condition). Anther in fabaceae is of two
lobes or two theca thus called dithecous anther. These two
characteristics are present in the members of fabaceae family
but not found in members of solanacea or liliaceae family.
Androecium: ten, diadelphous, anther dithecous
4. (a) In axile placentation ovules are attached to multilocular
ovary as in china rose, petunia and lemon.
5. (a) In roots, the protoxylem lies towards periphery and
metaxylem lies towards the centre. Such arrangement of
primary xylem is called exarch. Endarch and exarch xylem
are the terms used for primary xylem.
6. (b) In winter, the cambium is less active and forms fewer
xylary elements that have narrow vessels, and this wood is
called autumn wood or late wood.
7. (d) Both starch and cellulose are made of glucose molecules,
but the difference between them is that starch is branched
polymer while cellulose is a linear polymer. Starch also forms
helical secondary structures, so it can hold I2 molecules in the
helical portion. The Starch-I2 is blue colour. Cellulose does
not contain complex helices and hence cannot hold I2.

2. Chromatids move to opposite poles.
10. (b) The first two stages of prophase I are relatively shortlived compared to the next stage that is pachytene. During
this stage the four chromatids of each bivalent chromosomes
became distinct and clearly appears as tetrads. This stage is
characterized by the appearance of recombination nodules,
the site at which crossing over occurs between non-sister
chromatids of the homologous chromosomes.
11. (a) Active transport is a type of cellular transport in which
substances like ions, glucose and amino acids are transported
across a biological membrane towards the region that already
contains a lot of such substances. In active transport, chemical
energy (eg. ATP) is used to transport such substances against
the concentration gradient.
12. (b) A system of xylem vessels from the root to the leaf vein
can supply the needed water. A pull force is created as water
evaporates through stomata, and presence of water channel
in the xylem elements. Presence of lower concentration of
water vapour in atmosphere and higher in concentration in
the substomatal cavity and intercellular spaces. These forces
generated by transpiration can create pressure sufficient to
lift xylem sized column of water over 130 metres high.
